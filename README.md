# WebDev-CW2
Second coursework for my Web Development module where I created a basic library system to loan books to students.

Use the readme file in the cw2library-server file to set up the server. Run a local server in the main file to set up the page. 

The app allows users to add/delete/edit books, authors and student to a database. Loans can then be assigned to a user and a book with return dates.
